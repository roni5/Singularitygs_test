# Singularitygs_test
Using multiple $outputs ("calc", "isolation") within the same project.

This is a test project with Singularity-extras.
I wanted to see If I can have both fixed width and fluid width layouts within the same project.
Since I did not find something similar anywhere, I tried to do it myself, and this is the result.
Feel free to download and play with it. (You can also check it out at: http://sassmeister.com/gist/3a7f2be0411be9c22b9f).
Singularity rocks!
